# IoT-Based Smart Home Energy Management System


## Overview
This **Smart Home Energy Management System** is designed to help households optimise, control and monitor their energy consumption in real-time. With the help of **smart sensors and AI-driven automation**, this system provides detailed insights into energy consumption and load management for the household. This device enables us to take control of our energy usage, reduce costs, and promote sustainability through smart meters at the appliance level and seamless integration with mobile/web dashboards.   

## Why This Project is Useful
- **Cost Reduction**: Identify high-energy-consuming appliances and optimize usage.  
- **Sustainability**: Reduce unnecessary energy wastage.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track voltage, current, power, and power factor.  
- **Automation**: AI-driven load balancing and appliance control.  
- **Third-Party Integration**: Weather-based optimization.
